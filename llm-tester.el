;;; Commentary:
;; This file contains functions to help test the LLM implementation. Because of
;; LLM's inherent randomness, it isn't possible to have normal unit tests.
;; Humans should be looking at these results and seeing if they make sense.
;; However, we can test a few things automatically, including making sure that
;; no errors are thrown normally, or errors are thrown correctly when they
;; should be.
;;
;; The normal way to use this is to create a provider for each LLM you have
;; access to, and run `llm-tester-all' on it. Or, you can test individual parts
;; with their respective functions.'
;;
;; Both normal output and errors are output to the `*Messages*' buffer.
