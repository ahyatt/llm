;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides enhanced handling of MIME types for HTTP
;; requests within Emacs.  It utilizes the 'plz' library for
;; networking calls, extending it to process responses based on the
;; Content-Type header.  This library defines various classes and
;; methods for parsing and processing standard MIME types, including
;; JSON, XML, HTML, and binary data.  It allows for extensible
;; processing of additional types through subclassing.

  "Request METHOD from URL with curl.
Return the curl process object or, for a synchronous request, the
selected result.

HEADERS may be an alist of extra headers to send with the
request.

BODY may be a string, a buffer, or a list like `(file FILENAME)'
to upload a file from disk.

BODY-TYPE may be `text' to send BODY as text, or `binary' to send
it as binary.

AS selects the kind of result to pass to the callback function
THEN, or the kind of result to return for synchronous requests.
It may be:

- `buffer' to pass the response buffer, which will be narrowed to
  the response body and decoded according to DECODE.

- `binary' to pass the response body as an un-decoded string.

- `string' to pass the response body as a decoded string.

- `response' to pass a `plz-response' structure.

- `file' to pass a temporary filename to which the response body
  has been saved without decoding.

- `(file FILENAME)' to pass FILENAME after having saved the
  response body to it without decoding.  FILENAME must be a
  non-existent file; if it exists, it will not be overwritten,
  and an error will be signaled.

- `(media-types MEDIA-TYPES)' to handle the processing of the
  response based on the Content-Type header.  MEDIA-TYPES is an
  association list from a content type symbol to an instance of a
  `plz-media-type' class.  The `plz-media-types' variable is
  bound to an association list and can be used to handle some
  commonly used formats such as JSON, HTML, XML.  This list can
  be used as a basis and is meant to be extended by users.  If no
  media type was found for a content type, it will be handled by
  the default octet stream media type.  When this option is used,
  the THEN callback will always receive a plz-response structure as
  argument, and the ELSE callback always a plz-error structure.  The
  plz-response structure will always have the status and header
  slots set.  The body slot depends on the media type
  implementation.  In the case for JSON, HTML, XML it will
  contain the decoded response body.  When receiving JSON for
  example, it will be an Emacs Lisp association list.  For
  streaming responses like text/event-stream it will be set to
  nil, and the events of the server sent events specification
  will be dispatched to the handlers registered with the media
  type instance.

- A function, which is called in the response buffer with it
  narrowed to the response body (suitable for, e.g. `json-read').

If DECODE is non-nil, the response body is decoded automatically.
For binary content, it should be nil.  When AS is `binary',
DECODE is automatically set to nil.

THEN is a callback function, whose sole argument is selected
above with AS; if the request fails and no ELSE function is
given (see below), the argument will be a `plz-error' structure
describing the error.  Or THEN may be `sync' to make a
synchronous request, in which case the result is returned
directly from this function.

ELSE is an optional callback function called when the request
fails (i.e. if curl fails, or if the HTTP response has a non-2xx
status code).  It is called with one argument, a `plz-error'
structure.  If ELSE is nil, a `plz-curl-error' or
`plz-http-error' is signaled when the request fails, with a
`plz-error' structure as the error data.  For synchronous
requests, this argument is ignored.

NOTE: In v0.8 of `plz', only one error will be signaled:
`plz-error'.  The existing errors, `plz-curl-error' and
`plz-http-error', inherit from `plz-error' to allow applications
to update their code while using v0.7 (i.e. any `condition-case'
forms should now handle only `plz-error', not the other two).

FINALLY is an optional function called without argument after
THEN or ELSE, as appropriate.  For synchronous requests, this
argument is ignored.

CONNECT-TIMEOUT and TIMEOUT are a number of seconds that limit
how long it takes to connect to a host and to receive a response
from a host, respectively.

NOQUERY is passed to `make-process', which see.

When the HTTP response is streamed, the buffering in the curl
output stream is turned off and the PROCESS-FILTER may be called
multiple times, depending on the size of the HTTP body.  It is
the user's responsibility to understand and process each chunk,
and to construct the finalized response if necessary.  There are
no guarantees regarding the chunk, such as being line-based or
not.
