;;; Commentary:
;; This file defines a generic interface for LLMs (large language models), and
;; functionality they can provide.  Not all LLMs will support all of these, but
;; programs that want to integrate with LLMs can code against the interface, and
;; users can then choose the LLMs they want to use.  It's advisable to have the
;; possibility of using multiple LLMs when that make sense for different
;; functionality.
;;
;; Users should require this module and then the module of the LLM they want to
;; use.
;;
;; Not all LLMs might be able to do everything, so clients need to catch any
;; signals thrown with symbol `not-implemented', and surface an error to the
;; user that the LLM they have chosen cannot be used for that functionality.

CONTEXT is a string given to the LLM as context for the entire

EXAMPLES is a list of conses, where the car is an example
inputs, and cdr is the corresponding example outputs.  This is optional.

INTERACTIONS is a list message sent by either the llm or the
user. It is a either list of `llm-chat-prompt-interaction'
objects or list of an opaque converation ID (anything not a
`llm-chat-prompt-interaction') and the latest
`llm-chat-prompt-interaction' in the conversation to submit. When
building up a chat, the chat methods update this to a new value,
and the client is expected to append a new interaction to the
end, without introspecting the value otherwise. The function
`llm-chat-prompt-append-response' accomplishes that operation, and
should be used. 'Because this value updated by the called
function, for continuing chats, the whole prompt MUST be a
variable passed in to the chat function. INTERACTIONS is
required.

FUNCTIONS is a list of `llm-function-call' structs. These may be
called IF the LLM supports them. If the LLM does not support
them, a `not-implemented' signal will be thrown. This is
optional. When this is given, the LLM will either call the
function or return text as normal, depending on what the LLM
decides.

TEMPERATURE is a floating point number with a minimum of 0, and
maximum of 1, which controls how predictable the result is, with
0 being the most predicatable, and 1 being the most creative.
